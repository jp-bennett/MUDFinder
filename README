MUDFinder

MUDFinder is written in Python3, and uses flask-socketio. It's intended to emulate the feel of an old Multi-User Dungeon.
It's a tool for running Pathfinder (and other D&D) games over the internet. It can be thought of as a replacement for
roll20 and DnD Beyond, though not all of that functionality is finished yet.
