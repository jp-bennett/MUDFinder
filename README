MUDFinder

MUDFinder is written in Python3, and uses flask-socketio. It's intended to emulate the feel of an old Multi-User Dungeon.
It's a tool for running Pathfinder (and other D&D) games over the internet. It can be thought of as a replacement for
roll20 and DnD Beyond, though not all of that functionality is finished yet.

The MUDFinder project is licensed as AGPLv3 as a whole, but the individual contributor contributions are licensed as GPLv3.
The purpose of this is to allow the project owner to add user management glue code in his offering of MUDFinder as a service,
and not distribute that glue code as part of this project.
